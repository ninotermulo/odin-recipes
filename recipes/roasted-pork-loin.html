    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless pork loin roast</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup white wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Crush garlic with rosemary, salt and pepper in a mortar and pestle to make a paste. Pierce meat with a sharp knife in several places and press garlic paste into the openings. Rub pork loin with the remaining garlic mixture and olive oil. Set into an oven-safe pan.</li>
        <li>Place pork loin into the preheated oven, turning and basting with pan liquids every 30 minutes. Cook until the pork is no longer pink in the center, 90 minutes to 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove roast to a platter and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Place pan onto the stove over medium-high heat and pour wine into it. Heat wine and stir to loosen browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Simmer for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice pork loin and serve with pan juices.</li>
    </ol>
